## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Asteroid-Serverless/asteroid/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Asteroid-Serverless/asteroid/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with your suggestion.
- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add.
- Include code samples and screenshots if applicable.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Asteroid Serverless? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/Asteroid-Serverless/asteroid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/Asteroid-Serverless/asteroid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides
